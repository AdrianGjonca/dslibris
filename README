Herein lie the source for dslibris, and supporting libraries.

PREREQUISITES

Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch, OS X, and Windows XP have all been used as build platforms; currently I use OS X 10.6. Have:

* devkitPro r35: devkitARM, libnds, libfat, maxmod.
* on Windows XP, MSYS/MINGW. The MSYS provided with devkitPro is fine.
* A build of Freetype 2.4.6 for ARM.
* a media card and a DLDI patcher, but you knew that.

To build Freetype, 
1. copy etc/configure-freetype into the Freetype source distribution, and run 
it in lieu of ./configure.
2. make
3. make install. The installation will be in /usr/local/arch/arm-eabi.
 
BUILDING

cd ndslibris  # or wherever you put your git branch
make

dslibris.nds should show up in your current directory.
 
Note the support libraries in 'lib', prebuilt for arm-eabi; make sure you don't have conflicting libs in your path.

INSTALLATION

see INSTALL.

DEBUGGING

arm-eabi-gdb, insight-6.8 and desmume-0.9.2 have been known to work for debugging. See online forums for means to build an arm-eabi-targeted Insight for your platform.
