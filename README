Herein lie the source for dslibris, and supporting libraries.

PREREQUISITES

Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, OS X, and Windows XP have all been used as build
platforms. Have:

* devkitPro r31, as per the Windows installer.
* on Windows XP, MSYS/MINGW. The MSYS provided with devkitPro is fine.
* a media card and a DLDI patcher, but you knew that.

BUILDING

cd ndslibris/trunk  # or wherever you put your bzr branch
make

dslibris.nds should show up in your current directory.
 
Note the support libraries in 'lib', prebuilt for arm-eabi; make sure you 
don't have conflicting libs in your path.

INSTALLATION

see INSTALL.txt.

DEBUGGING

arm-eabi-gdb, insight-6.8 and desmume-0.9.2 have been known to work for
debugging. See online forums for means to build an arm-eabi-targeted
Insight for your platform.
