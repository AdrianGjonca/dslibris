Herein lie the source for dslibris, an EPUB reader for the Nintendo DS.

PREREQUISITES

Fedora, Ubuntu, Arch Linux, OS X, and Windows XP have all been used as build
platforms. Have:

* devkitPro r34 and its contemporary libraries (libnds, libfat, maxmod). 
* expat-2.0.1, freetype-2.4.3, and zlib-1.2.5, built for ARM EABI.
* a media card and a DLDI patcher, but you knew that.

To build expat, freetype and zlib, obtain the source tarball and see 
etc/configure-* for working configure incantations. zlib requires modifying
the Makefile for cross-compiling as well. Installation is into $DEVKITARM.

DEBUGGING

debugging. See online forums for means to build an arm-eabi-targeted
Insight for your platform.
