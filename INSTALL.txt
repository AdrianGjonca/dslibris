INSTALLATION

1. DLDI patch dslibris.nds to work for your media; eg. for R4DS

	dlditool r4tf.dldi dslibris.nds

2. Copy all files and folders in this distribution .zip to the root folder 
   of your DS media. Using a subfolder does not work!

3. Put any EPUB you have into the 'book' folder.
   The filenames should have an .epub extension.

4. Run dslibris.nds on the DS.


TROUBLESHOOTING
