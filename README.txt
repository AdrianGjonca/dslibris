Herein lie dslibris and supporting libraries.
The method below assumes you are using either MSYS/MINGW with devkitPro.

BUILDING

Fedora, Ubuntu, OS X, and Windows XP have all been used as build platforms. The primary build platform is OS X 10.4.

Prerequisites:

* devkitPro
* If on Windows XP, MSYS/MINGW. The MSYS provided with devkitPro is fine.

To build:

cd ndsibris/trunk
make

dslbris.nds is your target.

INSTALLATION

see INSTALL.txt.

DEBUGGING

Use insight with DeSmuME on XP and Linux. DeSmuME lacks the proper support t run or debug on OS X.
