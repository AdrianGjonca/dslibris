Alas! too soon,<br/>  We came aboard.<br/>  A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,<br/>  Before the always wind-obeying deep<br/>  Gave any tragic instance of our harm:<br/>  But longer did we not retain much hope;<br/>  For what obscured light the heavens did grant<br/>  Did but convey unto our fearful minds<br/>  A doubtful warrant of immediate death;<br/>  Which though myself would gladly have embraced,<br/>  Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,<br/>  Weeping before for what she saw must come,<br/>  And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,<br/>  That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<br/>  Forced me to seek delays for them and me.<br/>  And this it was, for other means was none:<br/>  The sailors sought for safety by our boat,<br/>  And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:<br/>  My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<br/>  Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,<br/>  Such as seafaring men provide for storms;<br/>  To him one of the other twins was bound,<br/>  Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:<br/>  The children thus disposed, my wife and I,<br/>  Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,<br/>  Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;<br/>  And floating straight, obedient to the stream,<br/>  Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.<br/>  At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,<br/>  Dispersed those vapours that offended us;<br/>  And by the benefit of his wished light,<br/>  The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered<br/>  Two ships from far making amain to us,<br/>  Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:<br/>  But ere they came, -- O, let me say no more!<br/>  Gather the sequel by that went before.<br/>      </p><br/><i>DUKE SOLINUS</i><br/>   <p>Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;<br/>  For we may pity, though not pardon thee.<br/>      </p><br/><i>AEGEON</i><br/>   <p>O, had the gods done so, I had not now<br/>  Worthily term'd them merciless to us!<br/>  For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,<br/>  We were encounterd by a mighty rock;<br/>  Which being violently borne upon,<br/>  Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;<br/>  So that, in this unjust divorce of us,<br/>  Fortune had left to both of us alike<br/>  What to delight in, what to sorrow for.<br/>  Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened<br/>  With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,<br/>  Was carried with more speed before the wind;<br/>  And in our sight they three were taken up<br/>  By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.<br/>  At length, another ship had seized on us;<br/>  And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,<br/>  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;<br/>  And would have reft the fishers of their prey,<br/>  Had not their bark been very slow of sail;<br/>  And therefore homeward did they bend their course.<br/>  Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;<br/>  That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,<br/>  To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.<br/>      </p><br/><i>DUKE SOLINUS</i><br/>   <p>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,<br/>  Do me the favour to dilate at full<br/>  What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.<br/>      </p><br/><i>AEGEON</i><br/>   <p>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,<br/>  At eighteen years became inquisitive<br/>  After his brother: and importuned me<br/>  That his attendant -- so his case was like,<br/>  Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name -- <br/>  Might bear him company in the quest of him:<br/>  Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,<br/>  I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.<br/>  Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,<br/>  Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,<br/>  And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;<br/>  Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought<br/>  Or that or any place that harbours men.<br/>  But here must end the story of my life;<br/>  And happy were I in my timely death,<br/>  Could all my travels warrant me they live.<br/>      </p><br/><i>DUKE SOLINUS</i><br/>   <p>Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd<br/>  To bear the extremity of dire mishap!<br/>  Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,<br/>  Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,<br/>  Which princes, would they, may not disannul,<br/>  My soul would sue as advocate for thee.<br/>  But, though thou art adjudged to the death<br/>  And passed sentence may not be recall'd<br/>  But to our honour's great disparagement,<br/>  Yet I will favour thee in what I can.<br/>  Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day<br/>  To seek thy life by beneficial help:<br/>  Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;<br/>  Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,<br/>  And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.<br/>  Gaoler, take him to thy custody.<br/>      </p><br/><i>Gaoler</i><br/>   <p>I will, my lord.<br/>    </p><br/><i>AEGEON</i><br/>   <p>Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,<br/>  But to procrastinate his lifeless end.<br/>      </p><p> [<i>Exeunt</i>]<br/></p>        <hr width=50><br/>  <center><h3>Scene 2</h3></center>    <p> [<i>The Mart.</i>]<br/>    </p><p> [<i>Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant</i>]<br/>    </p><br/><i>First Merchant</i><br/>   <p>Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,<br/>  Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.<br/>  This very day a Syracusian merchant<br/>  Is apprehended for arrival here;<br/>  And not being able to buy out his life<br/>  According to the statute of the town,<br/>  Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.<br/>  There is your money that I had to keep.<br/>        </p><br/><i>OF SYRACUSE</i><br/>   <p>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,<br/>  And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.<br/>  Within this hour it will be dinner-time:<br/>  Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,<br/>  Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,<br/>  And then return and sleep within mine inn,<br/>  For with long travel I am stiff and weary.<br/>  Get thee away.<br/>      </p>
