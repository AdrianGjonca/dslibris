This release changes input controls and adds a few long-requested features.

Controls:
* START exits dslibris.
  On DS this shuts down, and in 3DS menu systems you should return to that menu.
* SELECT now returns from a book to the library view.
* Y toggles a bookmark on the current page.

Settings:
* The preferences screen is now called "settings";
* New controls for screen orientation and bold italic font;
* Bold italic text is now rendered as a distinct style.

Installation remains the same: Download the zip file, unzip it,
patch dslibris.nds if you need,
and copy dslibris.nds, Book and Font to your root folder.
