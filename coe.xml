>&gt;  Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke<BR
>&gt;  To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,<BR
>&gt;  Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives<BR
>&gt;  Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,<BR
>&gt;  Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.<BR
>&gt;  For, since the mortal and intestine jars<BR
>&gt;  'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,<BR
>&gt;  It hath in solemn synods been decreed<BR
>&gt;  Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,<BR
>&gt;  To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,<BR
>&gt;  If any born at Ephesus be seen<BR
>&gt;  At any Syracusian marts and fairs;<BR
>&gt;  Again: if any Syracusian born<BR
>&gt;  Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,<BR
>&gt;  His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,<BR
>&gt;  Unless a thousand marks be levied,<BR
>&gt;  To quit the penalty and to ransom him.<BR
>&gt;  Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,<BR
>&gt;  Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;<BR
>&gt;  Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.<BR
>&gt;      </BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></P><BR

>A heavier task could not have been imposed<BR
>&gt;  Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:<BR
>&gt;  Yet, that the world may witness that my end<BR
>&gt;  Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,<BR
>&gt;  I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.<BR
>&gt;  In Syracusa was I born, and wed<BR
>&gt;  Unto a woman, happy but for me,<BR
>&gt;  And by me, had not our hap been bad.<BR
>&gt;  With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased<BR
>&gt;  By prosperous voyages I often made<BR
>&gt;  To Epidamnum; till my factor's death<BR
>&gt;  And the great care of goods at random left<BR
>&gt;  Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:<BR
>&gt;  From whom my absence was not six months old<BR
>&gt;  Before herself, almost at fainting under<BR
>&gt;  The pleasing punishment that women bear,<BR
>&gt;  Had made provision for her following me<BR
>&gt;  And soon and safe arrived where I was.<BR
>&gt;  There had she not been long, but she became<BR
>&gt;  A joyful mother of two goodly sons;<BR
>&gt;  And, which was strange, the one so like the other,<BR
>&gt;  As could not be distinguish'd but by names.<BR
>&gt;  That very hour, and in the self-same inn,<BR
>&gt;  A meaner woman was delivered<BR
>&gt;  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:<BR
>&gt;  Those, -- for their parents were exceeding poor, -- <BR
>&gt;  I bought and brought up to attend my sons.<BR
>&gt;  My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,<BR
>&gt;  Made daily motions for our home return:<BR
>&gt;  Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,<BR
>&gt;  We came aboard.<BR
>&gt;  A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,<BR
>&gt;  Before the always wind-obeying deep<BR
>&gt;  Gave any tragic instance of our harm:<BR
>&gt;  But longer did we not retain much hope;<BR
>&gt;  For what obscured light the heavens did grant<BR
>&gt;  Did but convey unto our fearful minds<BR
>&gt;  A doubtful warrant of immediate death;<BR
>&gt;  Which though myself would gladly have embraced,<BR
>&gt;  Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,<BR
>&gt;  Weeping before for what she saw must come,<BR
>&gt;  And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,<BR
>&gt;  That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<BR
>&gt;  Forced me to seek delays for them and me.<BR
>&gt;  And this it was, for other means was none:<BR
>&gt;  The sailors sought for safety by our boat,<BR
>&gt;  And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:<BR
>&gt;  My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<BR
>&gt;  Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,<BR
>&gt;  Such as seafaring men provide for storms;<BR
>&gt;  To him one of the other twins was bound,<BR
>&gt;  Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:<BR
>&gt;  The children thus disposed, my wife and I,<BR
>&gt;  Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,<BR
>&gt;  Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;<BR
>&gt;  And floating straight, obedient to the stream,<BR
>&gt;  Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.<BR
>&gt;  At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,<BR
>&gt;  Dispersed those vapours that offended us;<BR
>&gt;  And by the benefit of his wished light,<BR
>&gt;  The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered<BR
>&gt;  Two ships from far making amain to us,<BR
>&gt;  Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:<BR
>&gt;  But ere they came, -- O, let me say no more!<BR
>&gt;  Gather the sequel by that went before.<BR
>&gt;      </BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></BR></P><BR

>O, had the gods done so, I had not now<BR
>&gt;  Worthily term'd them merciless to us!<BR
>&gt;  For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,<BR
>&gt;  We were encounterd by a mighty rock;<BR
>&gt;  Which being violently borne upon,<BR
>&gt;  Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;<BR
>&gt;  So that, in this unjust divorce of us,<BR
>&gt;  Fortune had left to both of us alike<BR
>&gt;  What to delight in, what to sorrow for.<BR
>&gt;  Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened<BR
>&gt;  With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,<BR
>&gt;  Was carried with more speed before the wind;<BR
>&gt;  And in our sight they three were taken up<BR
>&gt;  By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.<BR
>&gt;  At length, another ship had seized on us;<BR
>&gt;  And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,<BR
>&gt;  Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;<BR
>&gt;  And would have reft the fishers of their prey,<BR
>&gt;  Had not their bark been very slow of sail;<BR
>&gt;  And therefore homeward did they bend their course.<BR
>&gt;  Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;<BR
>&gt;  That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,<BR
>&gt;  To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.<BR

>&gt;  Might bear him company in the quest of him:<BR
>&gt;  Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,<BR
>&gt;  I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.<BR
>&gt;  Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,<BR
>&gt;  Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,<BR
